8617,9968,gegeenthusiast,2,2,3,3,2,dating period is also a time where people really test their compatibility when things get rough though i personally don t find it any different than say spending time getting to know a friend really well but your fun to hang out with friend is not always the best roommate,en,272
8618,9969,gegeenthusiast,2,2,3,3,2,like i think i personally don t question the concept of romance and just think of it as a different shade of platonic feelings and i know a lot of people put emphasis on it so for me all that s important is that people consider the consequences of their actions as well,en,269
8619,9970,gegeenthusiast,2,2,3,3,2,because the choice to stay together isn t a real choice if you don t have the will or interest in doing so apathy or cold logical decision to stick it is not family it s a business agreement the cracks usually show and kids will be affected by it and for me that s important,en,274
8620,9971,gegeenthusiast,2,2,3,3,2,the waters through dating is a far better idea than going straight to marriage because you have to have some kind of love for each other to really make a family work even if it s not romantic love it s that love romantic or not that makes you want to keep making that choice,en,274
8621,9972,gegeenthusiast,2,2,3,3,2,oh i m not that big on the family step for me personally i always just see romantic attraction as a mirror of platonic attraction of two minds that just vibes well and you want to get closer so i don t discount the idea and for me personality compatibility and testing out,en,272
8622,9973,gegeenthusiast,2,2,3,3,2,oh yeah absolutely i think that romance is maybe a real thing that i just can t comprehend but everything else is an active choice you have to work for even if you love and care for someone there are always going to be days where they re annoying or frustrating,en,261
8623,9974,gegeenthusiast,2,2,3,3,2,on the other end i was also learning the fact that friendships can be just as loving and require as much maintenance so that s just what i assume romance needs is it correct who knows it doesn t matter to me hahahaha bitch i ain t marrying,en,239
8624,9975,gegeenthusiast,2,2,3,3,2,i guess it was also the fact that i am aroace and didn t really realize it then i still don t comprehend the idea of falling in love so i always interpret it as friendship but with extra commitment and more smoochies,en,216
