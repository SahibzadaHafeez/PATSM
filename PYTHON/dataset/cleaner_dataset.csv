mr_ncubec,42,100,96,84,87,"As I began to love myself I understood how much it can offend somebody if I try to force my desires on this person, even though I knew the time was not right and the person was not ready for it, and even though this person was me. Today I call it “RESPECT”."
mr_ncubec,42,100,96,84,87,"As I began to love myself I stopped craving for a different life, and I could see that everything that surrounded me was inviting me to grow. Today I call it “MATURITY”."
mr_ncubec,42,100,96,84,87,"As I began to love myself I understood that at any circumstance, I am in the right place at the right time, and everything happens at the exactly right moment. So I could be calm. Today I call it “SELF-CONFIDENCE”."
mr_ncubec,42,100,96,84,87,"I quit stealing my own time, and I stopped designing huge projects for the future. Today, I only do what brings me joy and happiness, things I love to do and that make my heart cheer, and I do them in my own way and in my own rhythm. Today I call it “SIMPLICITY”."
mr_ncubec,42,100,96,84,87,"As I began to love myself I freed myself of anything that is no good for my health – food, people, things, situations, and everything that drew me down and away from myself. At first I called this attitude a healthy egoism. Today I know it is “LOVE OF ONESELF”."
mr_ncubec,42,100,96,84,87,"As I began to love myself I quit trying to always be right, and ever since I was wrong less of the time. Today I discovered that is “MODESTY”."
mr_ncubec,42,100,96,84,87,"As I began to love myself I refused to go on living in the past and worrying about the future. Now, I only live for the moment, where everything is happening. Today I live each day, day by day, and I call it “FULFILLMENT”."
mr_ncubec,42,100,96,84,87,"As I began to love myself I recognized that my mind can disturb me and it can make me sick. But as I connected it to my heart, my mind became a valuable ally. Today I call this connection “WISDOM OF THE HEART”."
mr_ncubec,42,100,96,84,87,"We no longer need to fear arguments, confrontations or any kind of problems with ourselves or others. Even stars collide, and out of their crashing new worlds are born. Today I know “THAT IS LIFE”! ``Kim McMillen``"
mr_ncubec,42,100,96,84,87,"As I Began to Love Myself As I began to love myself I found that anguish and emotional suffering are only warning signs that I was living against my own truth. Today, I know, this is “AUTHENTICITY”."

catfancyceo,105,59,103,87,68,"@xLAWx_ Yeah that's why I amended it with ""less devastating"" because like personally Mt depression, while genetic, is also greatly linked to guilt over needing money and shame over being poor."

catfancyceo,105,59,103,87,68,"Some people just like to be miserable, honestly. They'd find something to complain about. I know *I* would be happier, but I can't speak for the entire populace."
catfancyceo,105,59,103,87,68,"Would people be happier? I'm pretty sure the obvious answer is a resounding ""yes!"" but there's almost always a catch-22 with this type of shit."
catfancyceo,105,59,103,87,68,"Like everyone would receive food, clothing, shelter, healthcare, internet access (which is a necessity at this point), clean water, higher education (not a necessity if you don't want it but a mighty fine need for some), stuff like that for free."

heyhildie,54,63,74,93,89,@Mormonger Not really. I feel that it’s not a human being—not alive—without a spirit. Just because it might be a child one day doesn’t mean it already is. Proper care and nutrition only account for so much. There’s a lot more that can go wrong.
heyhildie,54,63,74,93,89,"@Mormonger But the church has made no official statement as to when the spirit enters the body. If there’s no spirit, I don’t think it counts as a human being. Which is why, when I had a stillborn baby,I wasn’t allowed to give it a name and a blessing. It had no spirit. is it taking a life?"

heyhildie,54,63,74,93,89,@idahohurricane My great-grandmother really struggled with it. She lived in Austria post WWI. She had a neighbor who felt sorry for her and would give her milk from her goats from time to time. Everyone was poor and starving then so that may have been the issue.

_brokensweet_,107,65,85,80,62,@crowninglory_ @Malice_Alyce @RiahNotRia @RoyalFamily Corrections:  1. Imposing the English language by overruling native language and cultures is not a great achievement. 2. Practices like Sati were NOT abolished by the British. Read history carefully.   The British empire wasn't all bad but most of it was and you can't deny that.
_brokensweet_,107,65,85,80,62,"@crowninglory_ @RiahNotRia @RoyalFamily I guess @RiahNotRia was talking about the horrors of British colonialism which doesn't sit well with former British colonies like India when we talk about King's broadcasts in those days. While it is no doubt a sweet reminiscence, it's also a reminder of a deep colonial pain."

wandaswitches,111,69,83,85,85,I can’t believe directors didn’t think Winona Ryder was attractive enough to land parts. She is so stunning not to mention everybody wanted to be the horror girlie she was and still is.

wandaswitches,111,69,83,85,85,Also everytime i hear the phrase “I support womens rights but I also support womens wrongs I love when they do bad things” I think it’s coined for Wanda. She is such a great character that has so much support from stans for her murdeous rampage 😂

ashleighnevans,92,64,98,110,106,"God, it's been difficult to get back into the groove of writing. I gave birth to my baby girl 2 months and 2 days ago and this is the first I've written since. Only managed to get down 416 words in an hour - it's like my characters have left. I need to get them back!"

Your writing is fluid and the characters feel authentic. I would read this🙂  Here's an excerpt from my own WIP - ""Timeless"". Thanks for the opportunity💫  "
ashleighnevans,92,64,98,110,106,"1044 words down for the day! Not astronomically amazing by any standard, but considering the circumstances, way better than expected.
