9969,gegeenthusiast,83,85,104,100,71,like i think i personally don t question the concept of romance and just think of it as a different shade of platonic feelings and i know a lot of people put emphasis on it so for me all that s important is that people consider the consequences of their actions as well,en,269
9970,gegeenthusiast,83,85,104,100,71,because the choice to stay together isn t a real choice if you don t have the will or interest in doing so apathy or cold logical decision to stick it is not family it s a business agreement the cracks usually show and kids will be affected by it and for me that s important,en,274
9971,gegeenthusiast,83,85,104,100,71,the waters through dating is a far better idea than going straight to marriage because you have to have some kind of love for each other to really make a family work even if it s not romantic love it s that love romantic or not that makes you want to keep making that choice,en,274

9973,gegeenthusiast,83,85,104,100,71,oh yeah absolutely i think that romance is maybe a real thing that i just can t comprehend but everything else is an active choice you have to work for even if you love and care for someone there are always going to be days where they re annoying or frustrating,en,261
9974,gegeenthusiast,83,85,104,100,71,on the other end i was also learning the fact that friendships can be just as loving and require as much maintenance so that s just what i assume romance needs is it correct who knows it doesn t matter to me hahahaha bitch i ain t marrying,en,239
9975,gegeenthusiast,83,85,104,100,71,i guess it was also the fact that i am aroace and didn t really realize it then i still don t comprehend the idea of falling in love so i always interpret it as friendship but with extra commitment and more smoochies,en,216

10802,yt_missasyan,88,65,85,52,58,ya i think they got the characterisation across but its just shit that they had to use tropes related to trans and shit but idk its tiring to talk about this we prolly all want it to cool down i just feelin bad cus i follow the guy amp denying those concerns is sad,en,265
10804,yt_missasyan,88,65,85,52,58,i dunno about u dude but i think that when a trans guy says it s got issues about transphobia it s a valid point atlus should really not use such sensitive topics like that because it gives off the wrong impression to some like theyse denying actual trans ppl who transitioned,en,276
10806,yt_missasyan,88,65,85,52,58,damn the fact they didn t bother to reply shows they still don t get the point kekisu was putting aside the headcanons and just saying that trans ppl have concerns about how poorly they handled naoto s arc they didn t need that radical shit to prove their misogyny point,en,270
10808,yt_missasyan,88,65,85,52,58,all they were saying is that there are concerns by trans people how they handled naoto s arc they weren t forcing headcanons they closed replies because people were threatening her and shit and it s no use trying to argue because they won t listen i dunno i just feel sad,en,271
10810,yt_missasyan,88,65,85,52,58,i m so confused what to feel about this on one hand i feel bad because i follow the person and they re getting dogpiled on on the other i can t understand the points they re making headcanons are fine i thought atlus was fucked for using trans allegories too idk,en,262

10814,yt_missasyan,88,65,85,52,58,i think that s why i found it so jarring to play the game again in english voiceover it s the same problem i had with playing ffxv ignis turned from polite humble but friendly butler to sarcastic bri ish man i can t figure out how to make him sound casual but smart,en,265
10816,yt_missasyan,88,65,85,52,58,so like when you try to get that feeling in english it doesn t work i realise with a lot of in game dialogue he ends up sounding too polite or like too complicated sayin stuff like i suppose or that seems to be the case which kinda makes him sound snooty,en,254
10818,yt_missasyan,88,65,85,52,58,cus like when i write dialogue i often end up lifting some lines or words i ve heard while playing the game in jp and getting the corresponding translation thing is akechi speaks in a casual tender and gentle way in game but he s also as everyone knows smart,en,258
